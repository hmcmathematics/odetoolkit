<h1>History and Acknowledgements</h1>

Last Updated on Sept 20, 2013

<h2>Phase 1</h2>

The original software for
interfacing LSODA was developed at HMC by students: Kevin Carosso, Ned
Freed, Kristin Hubner and Dan Newman.

<h2>Phase 2</h2>

The original interface software was made user friendly at HMC and named
"ODEToolkit" by students: Anthony Leneis and David Richards.

<h2>Phase 3</h2>

Professor Joseph Fehribach at WPI obtained a grant
from Digital Equipment Corporation (now Compaq Corporation) to support
teams of students at WPI and HMC to work jointly to implement the
first version of ODEToolkit on the World Wide Web.  The WPI students
were: Richard Demar, Adam Howes, Michael Kingsbury, and Adriano
Palombizio.

<h2>Phase 4</h2>

The fourth generation of
ODEToolkit was developed at HMC, supported in part by an Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation grant to HMC and in part by the Mathematics
Clinic at HMC.  The manager of the ODEToolkit project was
Professor Michael Raugh, with web consulting from Professor Francis
Su.  The student contributors were: Mark Dean, Stephen Haas, Ben Hulse,
John Kodumal, Colin Little, Cameron McLeman, Jascha Swisher, Bryan
Tysinger, Andy Walther, Kevin Wong, and Carl Yu

<h2>Phase 5</h2>

The fifth generation of ODE Toolkit was redesigned and rewritten from the
ground up.  It was developed with guidence from Professors Robert Borrelli,
Courtney Coleman, and Michael Raugh of Harvey Mudd College and funded by the
HMC Math Clinic program. The student authors are:

<h2>Phase 6</h2>
The sixth generation of ODE Toolkit was redesigned and more thoroughly
documented. It was developed with guidence from Professors Chris Stone and
Darryl Yong of Harvey Mudd College as a Joint Math/CS clinic. The student
authors are:
<br><br>
Eric Doi (HMC '09, CS Major)
<br><br>
Andres Perez (HMC '10, Joint Math/CS Major)
<br><br>
Richard Mehlinger (HMC '09, CS Major)
<br><br>
Steven Ehrlich (HMC '09 Joint Math/CS Major)

<br><br>
<p> <b>Note: </b>
    The LSODA and CVODE solvers were written at Lawrence Livermore National
    Laboratories.  LSODA was developed by Alan Hindmarsh and Linda Petzold,
    and CVODE was devloped by Peter Brown, Keith Grant, Alan Hindmarsh, Steve
    Lee, Radu Serban, Dan Shumaker, Allan Taylor, and Carol Woodward.

<h2>Phase 7</h2>
The seventh generation of ODE Toolkit had some new features added and was even more thoroughly
documented. It was developed with guidence from Professors Talithia Williams, Chris Stone,
Darryl Yong, and Robert Borrelli of Harvey Mudd College as a Joint Math/CS clinic. The student
authors are:
<br><br>
Beky Kotcon (HMC '11, CS Major)
<br><br>
Anak Yodpinyanee (HMC '12, Math/CS Double Major)
<br><br>
Samantha Mesuro (HMC '11, Math Major)
<br><br>
Daniel Rozenfeld (HMC '11 Math Major)

<h2>Phase 8</h2>

During the summer of 2013, Max Comstock (HMC '13) 
removed some errors from the Runge-Kutta solver and fixed a other bugs. A few new 
functions were added and the interface was revised to be more intuitive. Development was guided by Professor Darryl Yong.
