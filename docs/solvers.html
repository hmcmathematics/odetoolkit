<p><h2>Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg 4th/5th</h2>
<p> Runge-Kutta_fehlberg 4th/5th is an adaptive stepsize algorithm.  It adjusts
    the stepsize in such a way as to keep the absolute error in a step less 
    than <i>Absolute Tol.</i> and the fractional error less than 
    <i>Relative Tol.</i>  See 
    <i>Numerical Recipies in C: The Art of Scientific Computing</i>, 
    by Press, Teutolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery, for more information on the 
    algorithm.
<p> <ul>

  <li> <i>Absolute Tol.</i>: RKF45 adjusts the stepsize in such a way as to keep the absolute error in a step less than <i>Absolute Tol</i>. 
  </li>

  <li> <i>Relative Tol.</i>: RKF45 adjusts the stepsize in such a way as to keep the fractional error in a step less than <i>Relative Tol</i>. 
  </li>

  <li> <i>Min Step Size </i>: The minimum stepsize that RKF45 should attempt to use. If the requested error tolerances cannot be achieved even when using the minumum stepsize, the solver will report an error. 
  </li>
  <li> <i>Max Step Size </i>: The maximum stepsize that RKF45 should attempt to use. 
  </li>
  <li> <i>Points/Time</i>: The number of points that should be graphed per unit time. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p><h2>Rosenbrock</h2>
<p> The Rosenbrock method is an adaptive, semi-implicit, multi-stage method . The Rosenbrock method can be thought of as a generalization of the Runge-Kutta methods. This is done by adding more parameters into the equations for this method. As a result of this generalization, the Rosenbrock Solver can solve stiff differential equations. This is something that the Euler Method and the Runge-Kutta methods cannot do well. Like the RKF45 method described above, it adjusts the stepsize in such a way as to keep the absolute error in a step less than <i>Absolute Tol</i>. and the fractional error less than <i>Relative Tol</i>.
<p> <b> Rosenbrock Options:</b>
 See the description of the RKF45 options above.

<p><h2>Euler</h2>
<p> The Euler algorithm is a very basic first-order, fixed step size ODE solver. It is included in ODEToolkit merely for demonstration purposes as it is inaccurate.   
<p> <b> Euler Options:</b>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Points/Time</i>: Specified the number of output points per unit 
       time that the solver should compute.  The stepsize is computed by 
       dividing the solve span by <i>Points/Time</i>.
</ul
