Tutorial 3: Entering Second-Order ODE's and Using Parameters
</font>

<hr>
<p>
<i> In the first tutorial, we learned how to enter a single first-order ODE
    into ODE Toolkit.  In this tutorial, we greatly expand the types of
    equations that we can work with to include second-order (and higher) ODE's.
    In addition, we learn how to define and use parameters in our equations.
    Note: In this tutorial, red text denotes invalid input to ODE Toolkit while
    green text denotes valid input.

<p> Consider the following equation, used to model the motion of simple 
    harmonic
    oscillators, 
<pre>
    x'' + (omega^2)*x = 0
</pre> 
The state variable
    <i>x</i> gives the system's displacement from its equilibrium point, and
    the parameter <i>omega</i> specifies the angular frequency of the system's
    oscillations about equilibrium. Your first inclination might be to enter 
    the equation as-is, or, remembering that ODE's must be entered in normal 
    form, you might try to enter it as <i>x'' = -omega^2*x</i>. Alas, it 
    is not so simple.  ODE Toolkit only supports first-order systems in normal form, but
    fortunately for us, almost any ODE of order <i>n</i> can always be written as an equivalent system of <i>n</i> first-order ODE's in normal form.  To enter the simple harmonic
    oscillator equation, we introduce a new state
    variable, <i>v</i>, defined as the first time derivative of <i>x</i>.
    Thus, our second-order equation <i>x''+omega^2*x=0</i> can be converted
    into a first-order equation by replacing <i>x''</i> with <i>v'</i>.
    Now we have the following equivalent first-order system:
<font color = "red">
<pre> 
    v' + omega^2*x = 0
    v=x'
</pre>
</font>

<p> Remember, however, that all ODE's must be entered in normal form, so to
    enter the system into ODE Toolkit, you would type the following into the 
    text input box:
<font color = "red">
<pre> 
    v' = -omega^2*x
    x' = v
</pre>
</font>
<p> Note that the derivatives of the state variables are always given on the 
    left-hand-side of the equations and that the right-hand-sides of the 
    equations are functions of the state variables and <i>t</i> only.  

<p> The above input is incomplete, however, since we have not defined 
    <i>omega</i>.  To define <i>omega</i> and set it equal to pi, enter the 
    following line anywhere in the text input box: 
    <i>omega = pi</i>. Thus, the final input should look something like this:
<font color = "green">
<pre>
    v' = -omega^2*x
    x' = v
    omega = pi
</pre>
</font>
<p> There are three useful things to note about this input.  First, although 
    each equation was entered on a separate line, they didn't have to be.  
    Equations can be entered on the same line as long
    as they are separated from each other by semi-colons.  Second, the order 
    in which the equations are entered does not matter.  We could have just as 
    well have defined <i>omega</i> first or defined <i>x'</i> before <i>v'</i>,
    for instance.  Third, ODE Toolkit ignores all spaces between identifiers 
    and operators, so the spaces around the equal signs are unnecessary.   
    For example, we could have entered the system like this:

<font color = "green">
<pre>
    omega=pi; v'= - omega ^ 2 * x;x' = v
</pre>
</font>

<p> ...or like this:
<font color = "green">
<pre>
    x' = v
    omega = pi; v' = - omega ^ 2 * x
</pre>
</font>    

<p> ...but not like this:
<font color = "red">
<pre>
    v' = -omega^2*x   x' = v   omega = pi
</pre>
</font>
